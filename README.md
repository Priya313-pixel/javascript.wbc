JAVASCRIPT :-

- Javascript is used for building logics of a web page.
- Javascript is a high level programming language, used in both client side as well as server side.
- Javascript comes from echma script so we see the latest version of javascript in the form of echma script.
- Now we used javascript version 6 i.e ES6 (echma script 6)
- In another way we called ES6 as the vanilla Javascript.
- Node JS is the run time environment of javascript.

Variable :-

- Variable is a container to store some data.
- In javascript thera are 3 types of variable are there...
1.var :
-var is a type of variable which is used for changing the variable in later stage.
- var is used in oldest browser so now a days we are don't use var most of the cases.
2.const :
-const means constant.
3.let :
-let is a type of variable which is also used for changing the variable in later stage.
-Now these days, most of the cases we used let for changing the variable.
-let is a block scope code so we have been used let in most cases.

Rules for creating variable name :-

-Variable names are case sensitive "a" & "A" is different.
-Only letter, digits, underscore & special character is allowed.(Do not keep white space over here.)
-Only letter, underscore or special character should be the 1st character only.
-Reserved words cannot be a variable name.
e.g.boolean,for,while,this etc...

Datatype in Javascript :-

-Datatype is an attributes associated with a piece of data that tells a computer system how to interprit its value.
-In datatype we used "typeof" operator to know what type of data it is.
-Mainly in javascript there are 2 type of datatypes are there.
1.Primitive datatype
-In javascript there are 7 types of primitive datatypes are there like...
1.Number - Number are the type of datatypes those it contains some numerical value.
2.Boolean - In boolean datatype we got boolean value like true/false.
3.Undefined - data is not define.
4.Null - In this datatype we got null for the value means nothing.
5.BigInt - In BigInt we will get the big integer value (-999999999 to +999999999) on the above .
6.String - String is a type of datatype that can hold some character like names or words etc..
7.Symbol - In symbol we got one symbol of more than one value.

2.Reference datatype
-Reference datatypes are the type of datatype which can hold multiple element in a single frame.
-Reference datatypes are -> Array, Function, Object
1.Array:
-Array is a collection of similar type of datatype which can hold contigious memory location.
-Array indexing start from "0".
e.g. let arr =["hari", "sita", "ram"]
                0        1       2
2.Object:
-Object is a reference type of datatype where we can store more than one elemenet is a single frame.
-Mainly object are working on (key:value) pair.
e.g. let hari = {
  "name" :"hari bandhu sahoo",
  "phone number" :687677777,
  "address" : "bhubaneswar",
  "carrier" : "good"
}          
-In the above example left side element are the keys and right side element are the values of that key.
